The first tag represent the creator of the pack

Here are the tags
Texture
Skin

There is no mash-up tag because it's split into the individual stuff such as the Festive Mash-up 2016, it's split into 3 files, the skins, the world template, and the texture pack. But you can only search for Mash-up's because they will all have Mash-up in the name because all I do is just copy and paste the name from the marketplace.
